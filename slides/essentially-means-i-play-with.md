note:
  CouchDB is the open source project in which Cloudant is built on, and CouchDB 2.0 that is due for release soon has a lot of the amazing added value that Cloudant produced added back to the project.

  PouchDB is a Javascript library that can interface seamlessly (most of the time) with CouchDB like systems and provide Offline first abilities to the browser. Or just act as a Node/Browser interface library for CouchDB.
